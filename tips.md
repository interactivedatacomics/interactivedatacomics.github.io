Make sure you tick the "Include id Attribute" checkbox when you export an SVG, it is unclicked by default.
If you have place-holder SVGs for being replaced by "slider" "variable" or isotype "icon" in the editor, make sure the place-holder SVGs are not covered by other any layers.
If you have any elements that are transparent, try to fill it with a solid color (e.g., the same color as its background). Otherwise, it may be filled with black in the editor.
If you draw elements by the path in your design tool, use outline stroke before exporting (on Figma you can right-click the path element and select "Outline Stroke").
Do not comment any code in the editor, delete the code you don't want before compiling the JSON Specification.
