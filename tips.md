# Useful Tips

* If you use Figma, make sure you tick the "Include id Attribute" checkbox when you export an SVG, it is unclicked by default.
* If you have place-holder SVGs for being replaced by "slider" "variable" or isotype "icon" in the editor, make sure the place-holder SVGs are not covered by other any layers.
* If you draw elements by path in your design tool, use outline stroke before exporting (in Figma you can right-click the path element and select "Outline Stroke").
* Do not comment out any code in the editor - instead, delete the code you don't want before compiling the JSON Specification.
