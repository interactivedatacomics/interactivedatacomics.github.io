# Interactive Data Comics

[Data comics](https://datacomics.github.io) are a way of effectively communicating with data through data visualizations. They are inspired by the visual language of comics. This project adds interactivity of data comics to support exploration, explanation, and engagement. Interactions include: highligting elemnts, adding and removing panels, interactive sliders and other UI elemnts. 

Check our [examples](examples.html), listen to our [tutorial](tutorial.html), [get started](getstarted.html) with your own interactive data comic, or check our [documentation](documentation.html) of all available interactive techniques.

If you have questions or suggestons, [get in touch](about.html).
