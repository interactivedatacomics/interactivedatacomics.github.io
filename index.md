# Interactive Data Comics

[Data comics](https://datacomics.github.io) are a way of effectively communicating with data through data visualizations. They are inspired by the visual language of comics. This page lists examples we found online and those created during our research. We hope this website and our examples support a wider discussion and inspire journalists, artists, data scientists, and others to create their own data comics and help exploring and discovering this novel medium.

This project adds interactivity of data comics to support exploration, explanation, and engagement.

Check our [examples](examples.html), listen to our [tutorial](tutorial.html), [get started](getstarted.html) with your own interactive data comic, or check our [documentation](documentation.html) of all available interactive techniques.
