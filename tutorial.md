# Tutorial

## What is this tutorial about?
The tutorial is part of our ongoing research on data comics and we are interested in improving our current interactions and authoring environment. The tutorial might be of use to you if you are planning to illustrate results from your research, want to tell personal stories with data, or engage a wider audience with data and visualizations.

[Data comics](http://datacomics.github.io) are a powerful means to communicate data with visualizations, inspired by the familiarity and graphical language of comics . As part of our ongoing research project at the University of Edinburgh, we are now designing interactive means to enhance understandability of and engagement with data comics. You can find examples of interactive data comics on our website: [https://interactivedatacomics.github.io](https://interactivedatacomics.github.io). (more examples will follow in the next days).

To solicit feedback on our research and help you build interactive data comics, we run a tutorial with consultation sessions over the next weeks. Our tutorial will cover the different types of interactions and help you scripting your own interactive data comic using a simple scripting language.

## Who is eligible?

While the tutorial is open to anyone with an interest in data-driven storytelling and data visualization, most benefits will be to those with a story or even some existing visualizations that they would like to turn into an interactive comic.

### What will you learn?

During the period of the tutorial, we will teach you how to create interactive web comics with visualizations. The tutorial features asynchronous learning with daily drop-in Q&A sessions. 

What are interactive comics: this happens in the live session on Monday, March 16, 5pm. The session will be recorded. 
How to create the individual panels: panels are created using vector graphic programs or other tools and need to be exported into SVG or PNG. You can find a full tutorial to create a simple comic here: [https://interactivedatacomics.github.io/getstarted.html](https://interactivedatacomics.github.io/getstarted.html).
How to create interaction using a simple scripting language. Once you have created all your panels, you can use our simple scripting language to add interactivity such as: 
* Highlight elements on mouse over
* Append panels on clicking elements and panels
* Load new layouts
* Replace panels
* Show and hide information
* Pan & Zoom insize panels
* Visualize data using simple pictograms
* Add UI elements such as sliders and text input

### Live Introduction and Overview (Monday, March 15th 2021, 5pm UK time. 30min)

The tutorial is split into several parts to accommodate for your personal schedule: 

Open to all. Feel free to join our intro session to see if interactive data comics are for you.

This live session gives an overview over our research in data comics and interactive data comics. It demonstrates examples of which interactions we currently support as well as the scripting language. The short session will be recorded and can then be found on our website. We conclude with a Q&A session (not recorded). 


### Web tutorials

[Our website](https://interactivedatacomics.github.io) will feature tutorial material, including short videos and a complete documentation of our interactions and the scripting language. We will add new tutorials and examples over the coming days.


### Drop-in Q&A sessions

We would like to help you with your personal data comic through a set of Q&A sessions where you can bring your comic and discuss any issues you may have. If you cannot make these Q&As, please get in touch with us to book a specific appointment. 

While not required for participation, we would like to kindly ask for your permission and written consent to potentially use your anonymized comments, questions, feedback and eventually (parts of) your comic to include in publication and presentations about our research (names can be attributed if you wish). More information on the consent and information here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gtE6DXby7t0Vw-a_6o0S_lT8Pigt0s3Ul1pfGQr1Qeg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gtE6DXby7t0Vw-a_6o0S_lT8Pigt0s3Ul1pfGQr1Qeg/edit?usp=sharing)

## What do we hope to learn? 

Our research focuses on improving the way we communicate data. This particular project seeks to investigate interactive means to make data comics interactive. To that end, we have created a simple scripting language and editor, allowing you to add interactivity on an existing set of comic panels and visualizations. The language is currently in a prototype state. Through the tutorial we hope to learn: 
Is our language expressive enough to create a range of comics? 
How difficult is it to learn
Which interactions and examples to people create using our language. 

These findings will inform our research on creating appropriate visual editors for data comics and potentially novel means for data-driven visual storytelling. You can find a list of publications here: https://datacomics.github.io/publications.html
