# Get Started

Using a simple example, this page gives a step-by-step overview how you can create an interactive data comic using propriatary drawing tools and our [specification](documentation.html). 

The specification is written in [Java Script Object Notation (JSON)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and is used to specify layouts and interactions on top of a set of drawn comic panels.   

The steps we  are as follows: 
* [Creating Panels](#creating-panels)
* [Specify layout](#specify-layout)
* [Specify data](#specify-data)
* [Specify operations](#specify-operations)


# 1 Creating Panels

Panels are the core of your (interactive)(data) comic and you will spend a significant amount of time scripting and drawing your comic

### 1.1 Drawing Panels

Panels are created using any drawing tool you like. Generally, we distinguish between the follwing two *formats*. 
* **Vector graphics:** which can export to the scalable vector graphic ('.svg') format. Commonly used tools include Adobe Illustrator, [Figma](https://www.figma.com) (which is free to use), Sketch, etc. 
* **Pixel graphics:** export into common '.png' files. The most prominent example tool is Adobe Photoshop, etc.

You can also draw panels by hand, scan them, and save them as '.png' files. 

### 1.2 Exporting Panels
Export each panel into its own file, either '.png' or '.svg'.

In our case, we have 3 panels, which we name as follows: 
* 'panel-1.svg'
* 'panel-2.svg'
* 'panel-3.svg'
